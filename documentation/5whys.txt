We had a lot of conflicts
Why?

We were all committing into the same branch
Why?

 We lacked an organized strategy for organizing our feature commits
Why?

We didn't realize how important version control was
Why?

We didn't come across any issues in version control early on so it was not emphasized
Why?

The beginning of the project did not involve class paths or anything that would affect another machine if pulled from Github.

Actionable process change, implementing a clear version control strategy that specifies names for branches as well as a uniform commit message to clear any confusions of features as well as what was added. 
Why?

This will help in organizing any future problems when it comes to merge conflicts.
